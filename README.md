# Hotel Booking Data Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of hotel booking data to uncover insights that can drive strategic decision-making in the hospitality industry. Using Python and its libraries, we clean, transform, visualize, and analyze data to provide meaningful business recommendations.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- The dataset consists of hotel booking records, including reservation details, guest demographics, stay duration, booking lead time, and price metrics.
- It contains information such as **arrival dates, cancellation status, number of nights stayed, price per night, and customer segments**.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack & Libraries Used

- **Programming Language:** Python 
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ðŸ“Š Data Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading & Inspection:**

   - Loaded dataset using Pandas.
   - Checked for missing values and duplicates.
   - Dropped unnecessary columns and handled missing values.

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation:**

   - Created new columns (e.g., `arrival_date`, `booking_window`, `total_nights`).
   - Converted categorical variables into appropriate formats.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization:**

   - Distribution of booking window.
   - Booking trends by season and month.
   - Proportion of bookings with and without children.
   - Analysis of cancellation rates across different customer segments.
   - Price distribution and demand patterns.

4. **Key Insights & Business Recommendations:**

   - **Cancellation Trends:** Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) had the highest cancellation rate (\~35%).
   - **Seasonal Patterns:** Peak booking months were **July & August**, while **November had the lowest bookings**.
   - **Customer Behavior:** **City hotels** were more popular than resort hotels.
   - **Revenue Optimization:** Suggested dynamic pricing strategies to adjust rates based on demand.
   - **Operational Adjustments:** Recommended **optimized staffing** for peak seasons and **flexible booking policies** to minimize cancellations.

## ðŸ“Œ Business Solutions

âœ… **Marketing Strategies:** Promote special deals during off-peak months to increase occupancy rates.
âœ… **Customer Retention:** Implement loyalty programs for repeat customers.
âœ… **Dynamic Pricing:** Adjust hotel rates based on seasonality and booking lead time.
âœ… **Flexible Booking Policies:** Reduce cancellations by offering non-refundable deposit options.
